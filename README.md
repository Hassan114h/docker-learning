# Docker Learning

During my learning of Containers and Docker I covered a range of essential topics including:

- Docker networking and creating custom networks  
- Docker Compose for multi-container applications  
- Docker registries such as DockerHub and AWS ECR  
- Multi-stage builds for optimized image creation  
- An introduction to container orchestration tools like Kubernetes

To conclude my learning, I completed a hands-on challenge by building a small project: a Flask application connected to a Redis database that tracks the number of visits.

See my progress below. Iâ€™ll continue customising it and adding cool features over time!
